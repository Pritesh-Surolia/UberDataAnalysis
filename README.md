# UberDataAnalysis

The study will look at several criteria such as the number of journeys made in a day, the number of travels made in a month, and so on. 
As a result of this study, we can determine the average number of passengers that Uber may have in a day, the peak hours when there are more consumers available, the number of trips identified at the highest on which day of the month, and so on.
